definition: Images taken outside the own house.
description: >
  Photographs can not only reveal how you look, but also what you like, your habits, or where you went for vacation.
  Today, algorithms can already analyse when and where a picture was taken by taking the position of the sun into account
  or identifying distinct landmarks. This collection shows images in which the model was removed, thus the location itself
  becomes the subject.
