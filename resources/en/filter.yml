  In every collection these charts give a better understanding of where the data-points comes from. In other words, the
  first diagram lists the top three countries users logged in from to publish a review. All other countries are summed
  in "Rest". Furthermore, the second diagram tells us what devices were used to publish the content. While
  Android and iOS refer to smartphones and tablets, the third category (if available) consists of unknown devices and
  access from desktop machines.
